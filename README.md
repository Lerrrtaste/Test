Boxing is one of my first projexts on GitHub and its goal is to be a simple timekiller and training your brain at the same time.

At the beginning from level-to-level different number of objects looking like numbers are shown in an empty room.

After a from level-to-level different time (~3-8 seconds) those numbers turn into boxes wich the player needs to click in the right
order to complete the level.

Clicking on the right box transforms the box into an animated green hook. For me it's essentially to have a great input feedback (giving
the player a good feeling when doing somithing right) wich is why i want to add some effects and soundswhen clicking on the right box.

All sprites are still placeholders. I will first focus on the game base before creating better sprites.

I appreciate EVERY contribution. :)
