Boxing is one of my first projects on GitHub and its goal is to be a simple but addictive minigame.

At the beginning from level-to-level different number of objects looking like numbers are shown in an empty room.

After a from level-to-level different duration (~3-8 seconds) those numbers turn into boxes wich the player needs to click in the right
order to complete the level. (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,...)

Clicking on the right box transforms the box into an animated green hook. For me it's essentially to have a great input feedback (giving
the player a good feeling when doing something right) wich is why i want to add some effects and sounds when clicking on the right box.

All sprites are still placeholders. I will first focus on the game base before creating better sprites.

I appreciate EVERY contribution. :)
